# Theoretical notes on Reinforcement Learning

A series of structured notes for studying reinforcement learning.

## Notes vs. coding sessions

There are 17 notes but only 10 coding sessions (`code/08_mc_vs_td` through `code/17_final_project`). Notes 01-07 are **theory-only** — they build the conceptual foundation (RL framework, MDPs, exploration/exploitation, policy vs. value methods, Bellman equations) that sessions 08 onward put into code:
